# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard
Data_analytics_project_Customer Behavior Dashboard Using Python + SQL + Power_BI 


📊 Data Analytics Project
🧩 Overview
This project demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow — from loading and cleaning raw data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), executing SQL queries, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal is to derive meaningful business insights and present them visually and professionally through a report and presentation.

📁 Dataset


Source: Public or company-provided dataset (CSV / Excel)


Description: The dataset contains customer purchase information, sales data, product categories, and regional performance metrics.


Size: ~10,000 records


Format: CSV



🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🔍 Steps Followed
1. Data Loading


Imported the dataset using pandas


Checked file integrity and handled encoding issues


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Checked shape, datatypes, and null values


Analyzed distributions, outliers, and correlations


Visualized key insights using bar plots, heatmaps, and pie charts


3. Data Cleaning


Removed duplicates and missing values


Standardized date and currency formats


Handled inconsistent categorical labels


Normalized numerical columns if required


4. SQL Integration


Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)


Executed analytical queries such as:


Top-selling products


Revenue by region


Average purchase by customer type


Monthly growth trends




5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)


Connected Power BI to SQL / CSV data source


Created KPI cards, charts, and interactive filters


Designed pages for Sales Overview, Customer Insights, and Profit Analysis


6. Reporting (Gamma App)


Summarized findings and visuals into a professional slide deck


Highlighted key insights, recommendations, and business implications



📈 Results / Key Insights


Identified top 5 revenue-generating products


Observed sales growth of 15% over the last quarter


Found that Express Shipping customers contribute 60% of total profit


Detected correlation between discounts and purchase frequency
